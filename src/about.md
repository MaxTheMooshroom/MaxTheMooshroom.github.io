Hello, I'm Maxine, a passionate and versatile technologist with a deep-rooted love for all things tech. Allow me to take you on a journey through my expertise and experiences!

From a young age, my innate curiosity led me to dismantle electronics and unravel their mysteries. This early fascination set the stage for a lifelong exploration of the tech industry. As a software engineer, I've honed my skills across various domains, mastering the art of building robust solutions.

In my projects, I leverage various software tools such as KiCAD and buildroot to bring ideas to life. Additionally, I have hands-on experience working with microcontrollers like PIC, STM32, TI, and RP2040, as well as platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. With these I have run FreeRTOS, ZephyrOS, and more, and have built software to run both on those and on baremetal devices, where appropriate. These resources have been invaluable in the realization of my endeavors.

While my expertise lies in embedded systems and holistic design principles, I embrace the opportunity to navigate through complex technological landscapes. Currently, I'm involved in the development of a dual-standard for IoT devices. This exciting project involves exploring the realms of home automation and addressing the challenges that the community faces. By combining my knowledge of embedded systems and holistic design principles, I strive to contribute to the community and drive innovation.

When I'm not immersed in tech, you'll often find me immersed in puzzle and engineering-focused games, keeping my mind sharp and agile. Engaging with communities and sharing knowledge is another passion of mine, as I firmly believe that true power lies in knowledge shared.

Collaboration is the driving force behind my work. I thrive in environments where ideas are exchanged, where I can draw on the collective expertise of my peers to design exceptional systems. I relish the opportunity to collaborate and invest deeply in projects that push the boundaries of innovation.

At the core of my approach is a relentless pursuit of improvement and a commitment to understanding projects at every level of abstraction. I strive to ensure seamless integration, greasing the wheels of systems and empowering them to run as smoothly as possible.

I invite you to explore my portfolio, where I showcase my work and demonstrate how my expertise can propel the tech industry forward. Join me on this exciting journey as we unlock new possibilities in the world of technology.
