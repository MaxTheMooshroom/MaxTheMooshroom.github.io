# Highschool Math

I'm an experienced math tutor for high school-level mathematics. With expertise
in Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Statistics, and Pre-Calculus,
I provide personalized learning support tailored to your student's needs.
Whether you're looking for remote tutoring via virtual whiteboard or in-person
sessions, my flexible approach ensures that every student gets the attention
they need to succeed.

## **Subject Material:**

I tutor a wide range of high school math subjects:
- **Algebra 1 & 2:** Mastering equations, functions, and problem-solving techniques.
- **Geometry:** Understanding shapes, proofs, and spatial reasoning.
- **Trigonometry:** Exploring angles, sine, cosine, and trigonometric identities.
- **Statistics:** Analyzing data, probability, and statistical inference.
- **Pre-Calculus:** Building foundational skills for advanced math concepts.

## **Teaching Methodology:**

My approach to tutoring is rooted in understanding your student's unique learning
style:
1. **Customized Learning Plans:** I use past and current assignments to identify gaps
in knowledge and tailor sessions to address them.
2. **Skill-Based Instruction:** Starting from skills the student already knows, I
build confidence by relating new concepts to familiar ones.
3. **Interactive Sessions:** Whether teaching remotely or in-person, I utilize virtual
whiteboards, diagrams, and real-world examples to make complex math concepts clear.
4. **Focus on Comprehension:** My goal is not just to solve problems but to ensure
your student understands the underlying principles.
