## Welcome to my digital hangout!

I'm Maxine, a developer working to open up communities for embedded systems (hardware, software, etc)
to go further with fewer resources. With a passion for working with others to help remove barriers,
I strive to develop powerful tools and frameworks that allow developers to access the full
potential of embedded systems. Hailing from Pittsburgh PA, USA, I've committed to doing what I can
to increase accessibility and foster a vibrant open-source developer community.

I have a fairly diverse background, having spent time teaching software, as a CTO, an AI researcher,
and now as an embedded software engineer (with several stints designing / working with embedded
hardware). I enjoy a wide variety of types of software development! I even designed and built this
site myself (with some notable help from my fianc√©e in a couple of documented places)!

Embedded systems are too important to be locked away behind outdated manuals and "proprietary interests",
so sharing that knowledge and empowering others to dive in is really important to me. To that end,
I work on several projects that make software development more accessible, such as
[Peacock](/portfolio#peacock) and its core libraries.

I've worked with a variety of devices, from standardized SBCs and SoMs, to custom microcontroller
boards with a variety of user requirements and constraints. Architectures I've used range from
various ARM `cortex A` or `cortex M` processors, to `x86_64`, `riscv32/64`, `STM32`, and `PIC`.

On the non-profit side of things, I have taken several classes on non-profits and received
certifications on my knowledge. I have also worked with multiple non-profits to both consult
for them, as well as develop tooling to ease their logistical burdens.

Currently [I tutor & teach private classes](/lessons), whether those classes are about good coding practices,
computer science fundamentals, software engineering principles, physics, maths, circuit-board
design, etc.

If you have any questions or otherwise want to reach out, you can contact me using the info found
[here](/contact).
