Howdy! I'm a developer working to open the embedded systems communities (hardware, software, etc)
to go further with fewer resources. With a passion for working with others to help remove barriers,
I strive to develop powerful tools and frameworks that allow developers to access the full
potential of embedded systems. Hailing from Pittsburgh PA, USA, I've committed to doing what I can
to increase accessibility and foster a vibrant open-source developer community.

I have a fairly diverse background, having spent time as a software teacher, a CTO, an AI researcher,
and now as an embedded software engineer (with several stints designing / working with embedded
hardware). I enjoy a wide variety of types of software development! I even designed and built this
site myself (with some notable help from a friend in a couple of places that are documented)!

In my free time, I work as a team lead for a group that's trying to make positive societal changes
by changing access to technology both physically and referring to information or documentation. 
Whether intentionally or not, much of the embedded world is gatekept from society, mostly by means of
information access. If you want to get deep into the field, you're going to be putting in a *lot* of
leg-work. We think that it's unnecessary to require so much effort, when that effort is primarily due
to a lack of knowledge.

I've worked with a variety of devices, from standardized SBCs and SoMs, to custom microcontroller
boards with a variety of user requirements and constraints. Architectures I've used range from
various ARM `cortex A` or `cortex M` processors, to `x86_64`, `riscv32/64`, `STM32`, and `PIC`.
