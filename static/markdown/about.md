## Welcome to my digital hangout!

Sup! I'm Maxine! I'm a software engineer that has very strong opinions about what it means to create
'good' software. My definition of 'good' software comes in the form of development priorities. First,
**<ins>make it work</ins>**. Then, **<ins>make it good</ins>**. Finally, **<ins>make it fast</ins>**.

**<ins>Making it work</ins>** is pretty straightforward. Does the project reliably perform its intended purpose?
Accrue any technical debt you need to in order to get this finished first. This is about pure functionality.
Most projects stop after getting here; if you stop after you get here, you have not created good software.

**<ins>Making it good</ins>** is the most nebulous one, I think. To me this is about being extensible and accessible,
where accessibility means being more than just an afterthought. Accessibility is a core design principle,
and means that you ensure that it's usable by anyone. 'Anyone' especially includes people who would otherwise
be excluded, regardless of whether that's becasue of disability, lack of technical background, financial
constraints, etc.

Going further, being accessible isn't just about the end-user. Is the project architecture conducive to
long-term development, both in terms of the data structures and the structure of the source tree? Is the
project well-documented? Can a developer learn to use it without spending hours studying it? Do new
contributors get proper feedback on their contributions? How difficult is it to become a new contributor
in the first place? All of this also applies to upstream dependencies as well. 

**<ins>Making it fast</ins>** is about optimization and making improvements where you can. But don't mistake its
position as the last priority to make this about "premature optimization" or whatever, I don't quite
believe in that (though that's a separate (but related) conversation). No, this is a matrter of paying
off some of that technical debt you accrued in the beginning.

And you might think that this bar is really damned high. And you'd be right! But it's not impossible. That's
why this is my standard for 'good' projects, not 'great' projects. I don't believe it's possible to be 'great'
by these standards. It's like the idea of perfection: always chased, never caught; greatness is something
projects should strive for, but should never consider themselves having achieved.

Anyways, as you might guess, I believe that technology is way too important to be locked away behind
"proprietary interests" and other excuses used to maintain one's position in society and the status quo, so
sharing that knowledge and empowering others is really important to me. To that end, I work on several projects
that make software development more accessible, such as [Peacock](/portfolio#peacock) and its core libraries.

<hr />

As far as my *background* with software, I've worked with a variety of devices. Anything from standardized SBCs
and SoMs to custom microcontroller boards with a variety of user requirements and constraints. Architectures
I've used range from various ARM `cortex A` or `cortex M` processors, to `x86_64`, `riscv32/64`, `STM32`, and
`PIC`.

On the non-profit side of things, I have taken several classes on non-profits and received certifications on my
knowledge. I have also worked with multiple non-profits to both consult for them, as well as develop tooling to
ease their logistical burdens.

Currently [I tutor & teach private classes](/lessons), whether those classes are about best coding practices,
computer science fundamentals, software engineering principles, physics, maths, circuit-board design, etc.

If you have any questions or otherwise want to reach out, you can contact me using the info found
[here](/contact).
