## Welcome to my digital hangout!

I'm Maxine, a developer working to open up communities for embedded systems (hardware, software, etc)
to go further with fewer resources. With a passion for working with others to help remove barriers,
I strive to develop powerful tools and frameworks that allow developers to access the full
potential of embedded systems. Hailing from Pittsburgh PA, USA, I've committed to doing what I can
to increase accessibility and foster a vibrant open-source developer community.

I have a fairly diverse background, having spent time teaching software, as a CTO, an AI researcher,
and now as an embedded software engineer (with several stints designing / working with embedded
hardware). I enjoy a wide variety of types of software development! I even designed and built this
site myself (with some notable help from my fiancée in a couple of documented places)!

Embedded systems are too cool to be locked away behind outdated manuals and elite vibes, so I’m all
about sharing the knowledge and empowering others to dive in. To that end, I work on several projects
that make software development more accessible, such as [Peacock](/portfolio#peacock).

I've worked with a variety of devices, from standardized SBCs and SoMs, to custom microcontroller
boards with a variety of user requirements and constraints. Architectures I've used range from
various ARM `cortex A` or `cortex M` processors, to `x86_64`, `riscv32/64`, `STM32`, and `PIC`.

On the non-profit side of things, I have taken several classes on non-profits and received
certifications on my knowledge. I have also worked with multiple non-profits to both consult
for them, as well as develop tooling to ease their logistic burdens.

If you have any questions or otherwise want to reach out, you can contact me using the info found

<!-- Welcome to My Digital Hangout! ✌️🌐

Hey there, wanderer of the information superhighway! I'm Maxine—a rebel-minded developer, systems engineer, and all-around tech enthusiast dialing in from Pittsburgh, PA, USA. I'm here to break down barriers and make the world of embedded systems way more rad and accessible for everyone. Whether you're hacking on hardware, slinging code, or just curious, you're in the right place.

By day, I’m an embedded software engineer who loves tackling tricky problems and building tools that make development less about stress and more about creativity. By night (or whenever I’m off the clock), I lead projects to smash the gates that keep people out of tech. Embedded systems are too cool to be locked away behind arcane manuals and elite vibes, so I’m all about sharing the knowledge and empowering others to dive in.

What’s my deal?
I’ve cruised through a kaleidoscope of tech gigs: teaching software, running a startup as a CTO, exploring the edges of AI, and now pushing the boundaries of embedded systems. I’ve played with everything from single-board computers to custom microcontroller setups, and I’ve had my hands on architectures like ARM Cortex, x86_64, RISC-V, STM32, and PIC. TL;DR? If it’s electronic and runs code, I’m into it.

What fuels my fire?
The dream of a tech world that’s open and inclusive. Information should be free, tools should be powerful, and you shouldn’t need a fortune or a PhD to create something awesome. I pour my energy into projects like Peacock, a GUI framework I’m building to make app dev as intuitive as sketching on graph paper. (Well, almost.)

Fun facts:
🎮 I’m a gamer and run a Discord server for underrepresented folks.
🛠️ I hang out at a local maker space, building everything from toys to tools.
🧠 I’m a proud punk who believes in shaking up the system—both the societal one and the kind that boots from flash memory.

So, kick back, explore, and don’t be shy! Hit me up on the Contact page if you want to talk shop, collaborate, or just say hi. Remember: The future is what we make it. 🌅 -->
